# cogimon-beamer-template

This is a quick and dirty verstion of cogimon official template re-written for `beamer`. 
It needs [fira sans](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraSans) font from mozilla and should be run with `lualatex` or `xelatex`. 
This comes with no guarantee so use it at your own risk.

### TODO
1. The title page
